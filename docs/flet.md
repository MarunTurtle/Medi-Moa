Controls reference
Flet UI is built of controls. Controls are organized into hierarchy, or a tree, where each control has a parent (except Page) and container controls like Column, Dropdown can contain child controls, for example:

Page
 ‚îú‚îÄ TextField
 ‚îú‚îÄ Dropdown
 ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Option
 ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Option
 ‚îî‚îÄ Row
     ‚îú‚îÄ ElevatedButton
     ‚îî‚îÄ ElevatedButton

Common control properties
Flet controls have the following properties:

adaptive
adaptive property can be specified for a control in the following cases:

A control has matching Cupertino control with similar functionality/presentation and graphics as expected on iOS/macOS. In this case, if adaptive is True, either Material or Cupertino control will be created depending on the target platform.

These controls have their Cupertino analogs and adaptive property:

AlertDialog
AppBar
Checkbox
ListTile
NavigationBar
Radio
Slider
Switch
A control has child controls. In this case adaptive property value is passed on to its children that don't have their adaptive property set.

The following container controls have adaptive property:

Card
Column
Container
Dismissible
ExpansionPanel
FletApp
GestureDetector
GridView
ListView
Page
Row
SafeArea
Stack
Tabs
View
badge
The badge property (available in almost all controls) supports both strings and Badge objects.

bottom
Effective inside Stack only. The distance that the child's bottom edge is inset from the bottom of the stack.

data
Arbitrary data that can be attached to a control.

disabled
Every control has disabled property which is False by default - control and all its children are enabled. disabled property is mostly used with data entry controls like TextField, Dropdown, Checkbox, buttons. However, disabled could be set to a parent control and its value will be propagated down to all children recursively.

For example, if you have a form with multiple entry controls you can disable them all together by disabling container:

c = ft.Column(controls=[
    ft.TextField(),
    ft.TextField()
])
c.disabled = True
page.add(c)

expand
When a child Control is placed into a Column or a Row you can "expand" it to fill the available space. expand property could be a boolean value (True - expand control to fill all available space) or an integer - an "expand factor" specifying how to divide a free space with other expanded child controls.

For more information and examples about expand property see "Expanding children" sections in Column or Row.

expand_loose
Effective only if expand is True.

If expand_loose is True, the child control of a Column or a Row will be given the flexibility to expand to fill the available space in the main axis (e.g., horizontally for a Row or vertically for a Column), but will not be required to fill the available space.

The default value is False.

Here is the example of Containers placed in Rows with expand_loose = True:

import flet as ft


class Message(ft.Container):
    def __init__(self, author, body):
        super().__init__()
        self.content = ft.Column(
            controls=[
                ft.Text(author, weight=ft.FontWeight.BOLD),
                ft.Text(body),
            ],
        )
        self.border = ft.border.all(1, ft.Colors.BLACK)
        self.border_radius = ft.border_radius.all(10)
        self.bgcolor = ft.Colors.GREEN_200
        self.padding = 10
        self.expand = True
        self.expand_loose = True


def main(page: ft.Page):
    chat = ft.ListView(
        padding=10,
        spacing=10,
        controls=[

                        body="Hi I am good thanks, how about you?",
                    ),
                ],
            ),
            ft.Row(
                alignment=ft.MainAxisAlignment.START,

                        body="Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.",
                    ),
                ],
            ),
            ft.Row(

ft.app(main)




height
Imposed Control height in virtual pixels.

left
Effective inside Stack only. The distance that the child's left edge is inset from the left of the stack.

parent
Points to the direct ancestor(parent) of this control.

It defaults to None and will only have a value when this control is mounted (added to the page tree).

The Page control (which is the root of the tree) is an exception - it always has parent=None.

right
Effective inside Stack only. The distance that the child's right edge is inset from the right of the stack.

tooltip
The tooltip property (available in almost all controls) now supports both strings and Tooltip objects.

top
Effective inside Stack only. The distance that the child's top edge is inset from the top of the stack.

visible
Every control has visible property which is True by default - control is rendered on the page. Setting visible to False completely prevents control (and all its children if any) from rendering on a page canvas. Hidden controls cannot be focused or selected with a keyboard or mouse and they do not emit any events.

width
Imposed Control width in virtual pixels.

Transformations
offset
Applies a translation transformation before painting the control.

The translation is expressed as a transform.Offset scaled to the control's size. For example, an Offset with a x of 0.25 will result in a horizontal translation of one quarter the width of the control.

The following example displays container at 0, 0 top left corner of a stack as transform applies -1 * 100, -1 * 100 (offset * control_size) horizontal and vertical translations to the control:

import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):

    page.add(
        ft.Stack(
            [
                ft.Container(
                    bgcolor="red",
                    width=100,
                    height=100,
                    left=100,
                    top=100,
                    offset=ft.transform.Offset(-1, -1),
                )
            ],
            width=1000,
            height=1000,
        )
    )

ft.app(main)

opacity
Defines the transparency of the control.

Value ranges from 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 (completely opaque without any transparency) and defaults to 1.0.

rotate
Transforms control using a rotation around the center.

The value of rotate property could be one of the following types:

number - a rotation in clockwise radians. Full circle 360¬∞ is math.pi * 2 radians, 90¬∞ is pi / 2, 45¬∞ is pi / 4, etc.
transform.Rotate - allows to specify rotation angle as well as alignment - the location of rotation center.
For example:

ft.Image(
    src="https://picsum.photos/100/100",
    width=100,
    height=100,
    border_radius=5,
    rotate=Rotate(angle=0.25 * pi, alignment=ft.alignment.center_left)
)

scale
Scale control along the 2D plane. Default scale factor is 1.0 - control is not scaled. 0.5 - the control is twice smaller, 2.0 - the control is twice larger.

Different scale multipliers can be specified for x and y axis, but setting Control.scale property to an instance of transform.Scale class:

from dataclasses import field

class Scale:
    scale: float = field(default=None)
    scale_x: float = field(default=None)
    scale_y: float = field(default=None)
    alignment: Alignment = field(default=None)

Either scale or scale_x and scale_y could be specified, but not all of them, for example:

ft.Image(
    src="https://picsum.photos/100/100",
    width=100,
    height=100,
    border_radius=5,
    scale=Scale(scale_x=2, scale_y=0.5)
)

========================

Card
A material design card: a panel with slightly rounded corners and an elevation shadow.

Properties
clip_behavior
The content will be clipped (or not) according to this option.

Value is of type ClipBehavior and defaults to ClipBehavior.NONE.

color
The card's background color.

content
The Control that should be displayed inside the card.

This control can only have one child. To lay out multiple children, let this control's child be a control such as Row, Column, or Stack, which have a children property, and then provide the children to that control.

elevation
Controls the size of the shadow below the card. Default value is 1.0.

is_semantic_container
Set to True (default) if this card represents a single semantic container, or to False if it instead represents a collection of individual semantic nodes (different types of content).

margin
The empty space that surrounds the card.

Value can be one of the following types: int, float, or Margin.

shadow_color
The color to paint the shadow below the card.

shape
The shape of the card.

Value is of type OutlinedBorder and defaults to RoundedRectangleBorder(radius=4.0).

show_border_on_foreground
Whether the shape of the border should be painted in front of the content or behind.

Defaults to True.

surface_tint_color
The color used as an overlay on color to indicate elevation.

If this is None, no overlay will be applied. Otherwise this color will be composited on top of color with an opacity related to elevation and used to paint the background of the card.

Defaults to None.

variant
Defines the card variant to be used.

Value is of type CardVariant and defaults to CardVariant.ELEVATED.

========================

Column
A control that displays its children in a vertical array.

To cause a child control to expand and fill the available vertical space set its expand property.

ft.app(main)

Properties
alignment
How the child Controls should be placed vertically.

Value is of type MainAxisAlignment.

auto_scroll
True if scrollbar should automatically move its position to the end when children updated. Must be False for scroll_to() method to work.

controls
A list of Controls to display inside the Column.

horizontal_alignment
How the child Controls should be placed horizontally.

Value is of type CrossAxisAlignment and defaults to CrossAxisAlignment.START.

on_scroll_interval
Throttling in milliseconds for on_scroll event. Default is 10.

rtl
True to set text direction to right-to-left. Default is False.

run_spacing
Spacing between runs when wrap=True. Default value is 10.

scroll
Enables a vertical scrolling for the Column to prevent its content overflow.

Value is of type ScrollMode and defaults to ScrollMode.None.

spacing
Spacing between controls in a Column. Default value is 10 virtual pixels. Spacing is applied only when alignment is set to start, end or center.

tight
Specifies how much space should be occupied vertically.

Defaults to False - allocate all space to children.

wrap
When set to True the Column will put child controls into additional columns (runs) if they don't fit a single column.

Methods
scroll_to(offset, delta, key, duration, curve)
Moves scroll position to either absolute offset, relative delta or jump to the control with specified key.

offset is an absolute value between minimum and maximum extents of a scrollable control, for example:

products.scroll_to(offset=100, duration=1000)

offset could be a negative to scroll from the end of a scrollable. For example, to scroll to the very end:

products.scroll_to(offset=-1, duration=1000)

delta allows moving scroll relatively to the current position. Use positive delta to scroll forward and negative delta to scroll backward. For example, to move scroll on 50 pixels forward:

products.scroll_to(delta=50)

key allows moving scroll position to a control with specified key. Most of Flet controls have key property which is translated to Flutter as "global key". key must be unique for the entire page/view. For example:

import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    cl = ft.Column(
        spacing=10,
        height=200,
        width=200,
        scroll=ft.ScrollMode.ALWAYS,
    )
    for i in range(0, 50):
        cl.controls.append(ft.Text(f"Text line {i}", key=str(i)))

    def scroll_to_key(e):
        cl.scroll_to(key="20", duration=1000)

    page.add(
        ft.Container(cl, border=ft.border.all(1)),
        ft.ElevatedButton("Scroll to key '20'", on_click=scroll_to_key),
    )

ft.app(main)

note
scroll_to() method won't work with ListView and GridView controls building their items dynamically.

duration is scrolling animation duration in milliseconds. Defaults to 0 - no animation.

curve configures animation curve. Property value is AnimationCurve enum. Defaults to AnimationCurve.EASE.

Events
on_scroll
Fires when scroll position is changed by a user.

Event handler argument is an instance of OnScrollEvent class.

Expanding children
When a child Control is placed into a Column you can "expand" it to fill the available space. Every Control has expand property that can have either a boolean value (True - expand control to fill all available space) or an integer - an "expand factor" specifying how to divide a free space with other expanded child controls. For example, this code creates a column with a Container taking all available space and a Text control at the bottom serving as a status bar:

r = ft.Column([
  ft.Container(expand=True, content=ft.Text("Here is search results")),
  ft.Text("Records found: 10")
])

The following example with numeric expand factors creates a Column with 3 containers in it and having heights of 20% (1/5), 60% (3/5) and 20% (1/5) respectively:

r = ft.Column([
  ft.Container(expand=1, content=ft.Text("Header")),
  ft.Container(expand=3, content=ft.Text("Body")),
  ft.Container(expand=1, content=ft.Text("Footer"))
])

In general, the resulting height of a child in percents is calculated as expand / sum(all expands) * 100%.

If you need to give the child Control of the Column the flexibility to expand to fill the available space vertically but not require it to fill the available space, set its expand_loose property to True.

Container
Container allows to decorate a control with background color and border and position it with padding, margin and alignment.

heading_row_alignment
The alignment of the heading row.

Value is of type MainAxisAlignment.

heading_row_color
The background color for the heading row.

The effective background color can be made to depend on the ControlState state, i.e. if the row is pressed, hovered, focused when sorted. The color is painted as an overlay to the row. To make sure that the row's InkWell is visible (when pressed, hovered and focused), it is recommended to use a translucent color.

heading_row_height
The height of the heading row.

heading_text_style
The text style for the heading row. An instance of TextStyle class.

horizontal_lines
Set the color and width of horizontal lines between rows. An instance of BorderSide class.

When a checkbox is displayed, it is also the margin between the checkbox the content in the first data column.

rows
A list of DataRow controls defining table rows.

show_bottom_border
Whether a border at the bottom of the table is displayed.

By default, a border is not shown at the bottom to allow for a border around the table defined by decoration.

show_checkbox_column
Whether the control should display checkboxes for selectable rows.

If True, a Checkbox will be placed at the beginning of each row that is selectable. However, if DataRow.on_select_changed is not set for any row, checkboxes will not be placed, even if this value is True.

If False, all rows will not display a Checkbox.

sort_ascending
Whether the column mentioned in sort_column_index, if any, is sorted in ascending order.

If True, the order is ascending (meaning the rows with the smallest values for the current sort column are first in the table).

If False, the order is descending (meaning the rows with the smallest values for the current sort column are last in the table).

sort_column_index
The current primary sort key's column.

If specified, indicates that the indicated column is the column by which the data is sorted. The number must correspond to the index of the relevant column in columns.

Setting this will cause the relevant column to have a sort indicator displayed.

When this is None, it implies that the table's sort order does not correspond to any of the columns.

vertical_lines
Set the color and width of vertical lines between columns.

Value is of type BorderSide.

DataTable events
on_select_all
Invoked when the user selects or unselects every row, using the checkbox in the heading row.

If this is None, then the DataRow.on_select_changed callback of every row in the table is invoked appropriately instead.

To control whether a particular row is selectable or not, see DataRow.on_select_changed. This callback is only relevant if any row is selectable.

DataColumn
Column configuration for a DataTable.

One column configuration must be provided for each column to display in the table.

label
The column heading.

Typically, this will be a Text control. It could also be an Icon (typically using size 18), or a Row with an icon and some text.

numeric
Whether this column represents numeric data or not.

The contents of cells of columns containing numeric data are right-aligned.

tooltip
The column heading's tooltip.

This is a longer description of the column heading, for cases where the heading might have been abbreviated to keep the column width to a reasonable size.

DataColumn events
on_sort
Called when the user asks to sort the table using this column.

If not set, the column will not be considered sortable.

DataRow
Row configuration and cell data for a DataTable.

One row configuration must be provided for each row to display in the table.

The data for this row of the table is provided in the cells property of the DataRow object.

cells
The data for this row - a list of DataCell controls.

There must be exactly as many cells as there are columns in the table.

color
The color for the row.

By default, the color is transparent unless selected. Selected rows has a grey translucent color.

The effective color can depend on the ControlState state, if the row is selected, pressed, hovered, focused, disabled or enabled. The color is painted as an overlay to the row. To make sure that the row's InkWell is visible (when pressed, hovered and focused), it is recommended to use a translucent color.

selected
Whether the row is selected.

If on_select_changed is non-null for any row in the table, then a checkbox is shown at the start of each row. If the row is selected (True), the checkbox will be checked and the row will be highlighted.

Otherwise, the checkbox, if present, will not be checked.

DataRow events
on_long_press
Called if the row is long-pressed.

If a DataCell in the row has its DataCell.on_tap, DataCell.on_double_tap, DataCell.on_long_press, DataCell.on_tap_cancel or DataCell.on_tap_down callback defined, that callback behavior overrides the gesture behavior of the row for that particular cell.

on_select_changed
Called when the user selects or unselects a selectable row.

If this is not null, then the row is selectable. The current selection state of the row is given by selected.

If any row is selectable, then the table's heading row will have a checkbox that can be checked to select all selectable rows (and which is checked if all the rows are selected), and each subsequent row will have a checkbox to toggle just that row.

A row whose on_select_changed callback is null is ignored for the purposes of determining the state of the "all" checkbox, and its checkbox is disabled.

If a DataCell in the row has its DataCell.on_tap callback defined, that callback behavior overrides the gesture behavior of the row for that particular cell.

DataCell
The data for a cell of a DataTable.

One list of DataCell objects must be provided for each DataRow in the DataTable.

content
The data for the row.

Typically a Text control or a Dropdown control.

If the cell has no data, then a Text widget with placeholder text should be provided instead, and placeholder should be set to True.

This control can only have one child. To lay out multiple children, let this control's child be a widget such as Row, Column, or Stack, which have controls property, and then provide the children to that widget.

placeholder
Whether the child is actually a placeholder.

If this is True, the default text style for the cell is changed to be appropriate for placeholder text.

show_edit_icon
Whether to show an edit icon at the end of the cell.

This does not make the cell actually editable; the caller must implement editing behavior if desired (initiated from the on_tap callback).

If this is set, on_tap should also be set, otherwise tapping the icon will have no effect.

DataCell events
on_double_tap
Called when the cell is double tapped.

If specified, tapping the cell will call this callback, else (tapping the cell will attempt to select the row ( if DataRow.on_select_changed is provided).

on_long_press
Called if the cell is long-pressed.

If specified, tapping the cell will invoke this callback, else tapping the cell will attempt to select the row ( if DataRow.on_select_changed is provided).

on_tap
Called if the cell is tapped.

If specified, tapping the cell will call this callback, else tapping the cell will attempt to select the row ( if DataRow.on_select_changed is provided).

on_tap_cancel
Called if the user cancels a tap was started on cell.

If specified, cancelling the tap gesture will invoke this callback, else tapping the cell will attempt to select the row (if DataRow.on_select_changed is provided).

on_tap_down
Called if the cell is tapped down.

If specified, tapping the cell will call this callback, else tapping the cell will attempt to select the row ( if DataRow.on_select_changed is provided).

Divider
A thin horizontal line, with padding on either side.

In the material design language, this represents a divider.

Magic methods
__contains__(control)
Checks if a control is present on the page, for example:

import flet as ft


def main(page: ft.Page):
    hello = ft.Text("Hello, World!")
    page.add(hello)
    print(hello in page)  # True
    
    
ft.app(main)

ResponsiveRow
ResponsiveRow borrows the idea of grid layout from Bootstrap web framework.

ResponsiveRow allows aligning child controls to virtual columns. By default, a virtual grid has 12 columns, but that can be customized with ResponsiveRow.columns property.

Similar to expand property, every control now has col property which allows specifying how many columns a control should span. For example, to make a layout consisting of two columns spanning 6 virtual columns each:

import flet as ft

ft.ResponsiveRow([
    ft.Column(col=6, controls=[ft.Text("Column 1")]),
    ft.Column(col=6, controls=[ft.Text("Column 2")])
])

ResponsiveRow is "responsive" because it can adapt the size of its children to a changing screen (page, window) size. col property in the example above is a constant number which means the child will span 6 columns for any screen size.

If ResponsiveRow's child doesn't have col property specified it spans the maximum number of columns.

col can be configured to have a different value for specific "breakpoints". Breakpoints are named dimension ranges:

Breakpoint	Dimension
xs	<576px
sm	‚â•576px
md	‚â•768px

ft.app(main)

Properties
alignment
How the child Controls should be placed horizontally.

Value is of type MainAxisAlignment and defaults to MainAxisAlignment.START.

auto_scroll
True if scrollbar should automatically move its position to the end when children updated. Must be False for scroll_to() method to work.

controls
A list of Controls to display inside the Row.

rtl
True to set text direction to right-to-left.

Defaults to False.

run_spacing
Spacing between runs when wrap=True.

Defaults to 10.

scroll
Enables horizontal scrolling for the Row to prevent its content overflow.

Value is of type ScrollMode.

spacing
Spacing between controls in a row. Default value is 10 virtual pixels. Spacing is applied only when alignment is set to MainAxisAlignment.START, MainAxisAlignment.END or MainAxisAlignment.CENTER.

on_scroll_interval
Throttling in milliseconds for on_scroll event.

Defaults to 10.

tight
Specifies how much space should be occupied horizontally.

Defaults to False, meaning all space is allocated to children.

vertical_alignment
How the child Controls should be placed vertically.

Value is of type CrossAxisAlignment and defaults to CrossAxisAlignment.START.

wrap
When set to True the Row will put child controls into additional rows (runs) if they don't fit a single row.

Methods
scroll_to(offset, delta, key, duration, curve)
Moves scroll position to either absolute offset, relative delta or jump to the control with specified key.

See Column.scroll_to() for method details and examples.

Events
on_scroll
Fires when scroll position is changed by a user.

Event handler argument is an instance of OnScrollEvent class.

Expanding children
When a child Control is placed into a Row you can "expand" it to fill the available space. Every Control has expand property that can have either a boolean value (True - expand control to fill all available space) or an integer - an "expand factor" specifying how to divide a free space with other expanded child controls. For example, this code creates a row with a TextField taking all available space and an ElevatedButton next to it:

r = ft.Row([
  ft.TextField(hint_text="Enter your name", expand=True),
  ft.ElevatedButton(text="Join chat")
])

The following example with numeric expand factors creates a Row with 3 containers in it and having widths of 20% (1/5), 60% (3/5) and 20% (1/5) respectively:

r = ft.Row([
  ft.Container(expand=1, content=ft.Text("A")),
  ft.Container(expand=3, content=ft.Text("B")),
  ft.Container(expand=1, content=ft.Text("C"))
])

In general, the resulting width of a child in percents is calculated as expand / sum(all expands) * 100%.

If you need to give the child Control of the Row the flexibility to expand to fill the available space horizontally but not require it to fill the available space, set its expand_loose property to True.

==================+

SafeArea
A control that insets its content by sufficient padding to avoid intrusions by the operating system.

For example, this will indent the content by enough to avoid the status bar at the top of the screen.

It will also indent the content by the amount necessary to avoid The Notch on the iPhone X, or other similar creative physical features of the display.

When a minimum_padding is specified, the greater of the minimum padding or the safe area padding will be applied.

Example
Live example

import flet as ft

class State:
    counter = 0

def main(page: ft.Page):
    state = State()

    def add_click(e):
        state.counter += 1
        counter.value = str(state.counter)
        counter.update()

    page.floating_action_button = ft.FloatingActionButton(
        icon=ft.Icons.ADD, on_click=add_click
    )
    page.add(
        ft.SafeArea(
            ft.Container(
                counter := ft.Text("0", size=50),
                alignment=ft.alignment.center,
            ),
            expand=True,
        )
    )

ft.app(main)

Properties
bottom
Whether to avoid system intrusions on the bottom side of the screen.

Defaults to True.

content
A Control to display inside safe area.

left
Whether to avoid system intrusions on the left.

Defaults to True.

maintain_bottom_view_padding
Specifies whether the SafeArea should maintain the bottom MediaQueryData.viewPadding instead of the bottom MediaQueryData.padding, defaults to False.

For example, if there is an onscreen keyboard displayed above the SafeArea, the padding can be maintained below the obstruction rather than being consumed. This can be helpful in cases where your layout contains flexible controls, which could visibly move when opening a software keyboard due to the change in the padding value. Setting this to true will avoid the UI shift.

minimum
This minimum padding to apply.

The greater of the minimum insets and the media padding will be applied.

Deprecated (renamed) in v0.23.0 and will be removed in v0.26.0. Use minimum_padding instead.

minimum_padding
This minimum padding to apply.

The greater of the minimum insets and the media padding will be applied.

right
Whether to avoid system intrusions on the right.

Defaults to True.

top
Whether to avoid system intrusions at the top of the screen, typically the system status bar.

Defaults to True.

=================

Stack
A control that positions its children on top of each other.

This control is useful if you want to overlap several children in a simple way, for example having some text and an image, overlaid with a gradient and a button attached to the bottom.

Stack is also useful if you want to implement implicit animations that require knowing absolute position of a target value.

If present, the semantics of this control will contain this value instead of the actual text. This will overwrite any of the TextSpan.semantics_labels.

This is useful for replacing abbreviations or shorthands with the full text value:

Value is of type str.

ft.Text("$$", semantics_label="Double dollars")

size
Text size in virtual pixels.

Value is of type OptionalNumber and defaults to 14.

spans
The list of TextSpan objects to build a rich text paragraph.

ProgressBar
A material design linear progress indicator, also known as a progress bar.

A control that shows progress along a line.

There are two kinds of linear progress indicators:

Determinate. Determinate progress indicators have a specific value at each point in time, and the value should increase monotonically from 0.0 to 1.0, at which time the indicator is complete. To create a determinate progress indicator, use a non-null value between 0.0 and 1.0.
Indeterminate. Indeterminate progress indicators do not have a specific value at each point in time and instead indicate that progress is being made without indicating how much progress remains. To create an indeterminate progress indicator, use a null value.
Examples
Live example

Python
from time import sleep

import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    pb = ft.ProgressBar(width=400)

    page.add(
        ft.Text("Linear progress indicator", style="headlineSmall"),
        ft.Column([ ft.Text("Doing something..."), pb]),
        ft.Text("Indeterminate progress bar", style="headlineSmall"),
        ft.ProgressBar(width=400, color="amber", bgcolor="#eeeeee"),
    )

    for i in range(0, 101):
        pb.value = i * 0.01
        sleep(0.1)
        page.update()

ft.app(main)


Properties
value
The value of this progress indicator. A value of 0.0 means no progress and 1.0 means that progress is complete. The value will be clamped to be in the range 0.0 - 1.0.

Defaults to None, meaning that this progress indicator is indeterminate - displays a predetermined animation that does not indicate how much actual progress is being made.

bar_height
The minimum height of the line used to draw the linear indicator.

Defaults to 4.

border_radius
The border radius of both the indicator and the track. Border radius is an instance of BorderRadius class.

Defaults to border_radius.all(0) - rectangular shape.

bgcolor
Color of the track being filled by the linear indicator.

color
The progress indicator's color.

semantics_label
The Semantics.label for this progress indicator.

semantics_value
The Semantics.value for this progress indicator.

tooltip
The text displayed when hovering the mouse over the control.

============

ProgressRing
A material design circular progress indicator, which spins to indicate that the application is busy.

A control that shows progress along a circle.

There are two kinds of circular progress indicators:

Determinate. Determinate progress indicators have a specific value at each point in time, and the value should increase monotonically from 0.0 to 1.0, at which time the indicator is complete. To create a determinate progress indicator, use a non-null value between 0.0 and 1.0.
Indeterminate. Indeterminate progress indicators do not have a specific value at each point in time and instead indicate that progress is being made without indicating how much progress remains. To create an indeterminate progress indicator, use a null value.
Examples
Live example

Python
from time import sleep
import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    pr = ft.ProgressRing(width=16, height=16, stroke_width = 2)

    page.add(
        ft.Text("Circular progress indicator", style="headlineSmall"),
        ft.Row([pr, ft.Text("Wait for the completion...")]),
        ft.Text("Indeterminate cicrular progress", style="headlineSmall"),
        ft.Column(

            horizontal_alignment=ft.CrossAxisAlignment.CENTER,
        ),
    )

    for i in range(0, 101):
        pr.value = i * 0.01
        sleep(0.1)
        page.update()

ft.app(main)


Properties
bgcolor
Color of the circular track being filled by the circular indicator.

color
The progress indicator's color.

semantics_label
The Semantics.label for this progress indicator.

semantics_value
The Semantics.value for this progress indicator.

stroke_align
The relative position of the stroke. Value typically ranges be -1.0 (inside stroke) and 1.0 (outside stroke).

Defaults to 0 - centered.

stroke_cap
The progress indicator's line ending.

Value is of type StrokeCap.

stroke_width
The width of the line used to draw the circle.

tooltip
The text displayed when hovering the mouse over the control.

value
The value of this progress indicator. A value of 0.0 means no progress and 1.0 means that progress is complete. The value will be clamped to be in the range 0.0 - 1.0. If None, this progress indicator is indeterminate, which means the indicator displays a predetermined animation that does not indicate how much actual progress is being made.
